Data ingest demo

Demo project that imports data into a Postgres instance.

In this case the database is run from a docker container, this can be started using `docker compose up`.

This project also relies on the Kaggle API. Credentials are required to be stored where the API can find them. See [kaggle.com](url) for more information.
